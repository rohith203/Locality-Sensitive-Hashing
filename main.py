"""
This program aims to detect plagiarism using Locality Sensitive Hahsing(LSH)

Process:
    - shingling: converting documents into set of tokens. each token is called 
        as shingle which is a sequence of characters present in file. This process
        generates a sparse incidence matrix
    - minhashing: as incidence matrix is sparse, this step aims to reduce the 
        size of matrix by producing signature for each document present in the 
        incidence matrix
    - lsh: dividing signature matrix into horizontal bands and applying hash
        functions on them to determing which documents fall in same bucket

NOTE: if pickle(binary) files exist for each operation, they will be used 
    instead of generating them again(to save time). rename or delete the file
    to start afresh.
